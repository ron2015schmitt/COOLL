# Tensor dot product

* Use new `<D1,D2>` methodology, following the `operator+` code
* Implement dot product for each tensor class:
   * Scalar â€¢ Scalar
* Implement dot product between objects of different tensor class / dimensions. Sum along the inner dimensionof each.
* implement `inner(t1,t2)` functions as well as `operator|`
