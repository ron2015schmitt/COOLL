# Tensor dot product

* Use new `<D1,D2>` methodology, following the `operator+` code
* Implement dot product for each tensor class:
   * Scalar • Scalar
   * Vector • Vector
   * Vector • Matrix
   * Matrix • Vector
   * Matrix • Matrix
* For Tensor class sum along the inner dimension of each.
* implement `inner(t1,t2)` functions as well as `operator|`
