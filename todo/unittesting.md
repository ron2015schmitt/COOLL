# Unit Testing

_Back to [Table of Contents](README.md)_

* need to purchase a new matlab license
* have only one executable, test.cpp
* inclue all tests as .cpp files into the main of test.cpp
* in this manner, all tests will be summarized in one final paragraph

* Write automated unit test creation code that can be re-used for Scalar, Vector, Matrix, and Tensor.  
   * `test/create/createtests.cpp` has been started.  
   * currently using `bc`
   * will switch to `matlab` to calculate the expected results
   * start using Python instead of C++ for the scripting
   
   
* unit tests for helper types. Automate some of this.
   * Imaginary (use same test functions as that of Scalar, Vector etc)
   * Dimensions
   * Indices
   * Index
   * VectorofPtrs
   * calculus (on doc page)
   * Fourier Series
   * Taylor Series
