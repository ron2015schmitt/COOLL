## Goal

The goal of the Math√©matiques project is to provide a _library_ for 
* numerical computation
* computation sciences
* engineering simulations
* computer graphics

that is
* user friendly
* feature rich
* flexible

has 
* simple compact syntax

with
* easy-to-use output functions that produce clearly formatted results in color, including type information
* debug modes for bounds and dimension checking
* production mode that runs as fast as possible, without any checking

producing executables that are
* fast
* memory efficient

## Language

C++ was chosen for its efficiency and because it has the features, such as templating, needed to create a syntax.

# Influences

* Matlab
* Fortran95
* Mathematica
* Boost C++
* Python
