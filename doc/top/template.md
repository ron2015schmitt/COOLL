Mathématiques is numerical library for performing linear algebra, calculus, vector calculus, etc in C++ via simple MATLAB-like syntax while also providing run-time performance and memory usage of hand-coded C or Fortran.

_Mathématiques distinguishes itself from other libraries by an elegance and versatility that are only possible using the features of C++11,14, and 17._

  + Simple Matlab-like syntax with no run-time cost
  + linear algebra
  + calculus
  + Performance comparable to C and Fortran
  + Pretty printing with styles and colors
  + Debugging mode
  + File I/O in various formats including formats for Matlab and Mathematica
  + Detailed pretty documentation in Markup.  
  + Markup Documents can be auto-generated from C++ code.
  + "Boiler plate" code is created using Python scripts for supporting functionality such as mixed-type math
