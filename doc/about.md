Development for this project originally took place during the years 2003-2008 

The code resurrected in 2019, improved, and put on github.

The code uses a form of C++ [template metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming) called [expression templating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_templates), the library provides computational efficiency on par with C/Fortran.

*Expression templating* produces complex code in the library itself, but the *user code* is simple, clean, and extremely efficient.

The GNU gcc (g++) compiler is used by default.
